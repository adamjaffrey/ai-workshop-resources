# Changelog

## v26.0.5 — 2026-10-16

**Built at:** Fri 16 Oct 2026 at 10:41:38 am AEDT (+11:00)

**Built by:** Adam Jaffrey

**Build assisted by agent:** ChatGPT Codex

### Summary

Add a workshop password gate and reduce header branding

### Added

- Add a browser-side password gate with a Lucide lock icon, masked password field and grey blurred backdrop.
- Keep background controls inactive until unlocked, contain keyboard focus, report incorrect passwords and remember access for the current tab session.
- Allow unlocking when browser session storage is unavailable. This presentation gate is not server-side access control.

### Changed

- Remove the logo's blue tile, show a smaller black worm and reduce the Mark Pro WAVELENGTH wordmark to 16 pixels.

### Validation

- Chrome — incorrect and correct passwords, Enter submission, focus containment, session persistence, new-session gating and unavailable storage passed.
- All four installation prompts, real clipboard copies and manual copying after simulated clipboard denial — passed.
- Desktop and mobile gate screenshots, unlocked-page review and mobile overflow checks — passed; no browser errors.

## v26.0.4 — 2026-10-16

### Summary

Add Wavelength branding and contain the website artefact

### Added

- Add the existing Wavelength worm logo and WAVELENGTH wordmark using bundled Mark Pro Bold from Client Onboarder.

### Changed

- Use white text and icons on the selected agent toggle and blue numbered badges.
- Keep the standalone page, assets and version authority together in `website/`; move the website version authority from the repository root to `website/VERSION.txt`.
- Retain shared project governance at the repository root.

### Validation

- Chrome — logo loading, Mark Pro font loading and white foregrounds on both selected-agent states and numbered badges passed.
- All four prompt variants, clipboard copying, forced-copy-failure selection and manual keyboard copying — passed.
- Desktop visual review and mobile overflow check — passed with no browser errors.

### Summary

Apply Wavelength colours and improve icons and copy feedback

### Changed

- Match Client Onboarder's approved blue, ink and pale-grey palette, with darker blue for readable text.
- Use Lucide clipboard-list, code-xml, copy and check icons, and Codex and Claude brand marks from Lobe Icons with bundled licences.
- Emphasise skill order with prominent numbered badges.

### Fixed

- Replace the malformed assistant slash with the standard Lucide code-xml path.
- Keep prompts manually selectable and select the complete prompt with keyboard-copy guidance when automatic clipboard methods fail.

### Validation

- Chrome — all four individual prompts and real clipboard copies passed; no browser errors.
- Forced native and legacy clipboard failures — exact prompt selection and manual keyboard copy passed.
- Direct mouse selection and visible success icons — passed.
- Desktop and mobile visual review and mobile overflow checks — passed.
