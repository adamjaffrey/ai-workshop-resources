### Removed

- Remove the old favicon and unused window, file and globe scaffold icons.

### Validation

- Authentication source tests — all eight passed.
- Sites production build — passed.
- Chrome preview — both colour states, three badges, toggle, Claude Code artwork, favicon, images and mobile fit passed; no script errors.
